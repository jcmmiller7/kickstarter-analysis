# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Project Overview
The Kickstarter data set contains information on 4115 campaigns. Some of the important variables included in the data set include the outcome of the campaign (successful, failed, canceled, or live), the average donation to the campaign, the percentage funded (pledge to goal ratio), length of the campaign, and the category. The purpose of the project is to manipulate and analyze these variables to calculate statistical information in order to discover trends within the data. These trends are useful as they can be utilized by future kickstarters as a baseline to gauge potential success or failure prior to the campaign launch. Two deliverables were created to aid the user in thier understanding of the data. The first is the outcomes based on launch date. The second is the outocmes based on goal. Grapical visualizations were created to bring the data to life. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The first part of the analysis invlolved filtering and sorting the data to make it more user friendly. A Years columns was added to the spreadsheet  using the year function in excel, which extracts the year from the date created conversion column. Next, a pivot table was created based on the parent category and years columns. Refer to the screenshot:

The pivot table was further manipulated to only include data based on theater outcomes and then a line chart was created to visualized this information. It is provided via screenshot:

The second part of the analysis invlolved using the count if function in excel to further visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. A new spreadsheet was created for this data. Here is a screenshot of the new spreadsheet:
