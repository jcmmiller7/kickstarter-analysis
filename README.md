# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Project Overview
The Kickstarter data set contains information on 4115 campaigns. Some of the important variables included in the data set include the outcome of the campaign (successful, failed, canceled, or live), the average donation to the campaign, the percentage funded (pledge to goal ratio), length of the campaign, and the category. The purpose of the project is to manipulate and analyze these variables to calculate statistical information in order to discover trends within the data. These trends are useful as they can be utilized by future kickstarters as a baseline to gauge potential success or failure prior to the campaign launch. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The first part of the analysis invlolved filtering and sorting the data to make it more user friendly. This invloved freezing column and row names in order to not get lost in the data set. Additionally, conditional formatting was implemented on outcome column to color code the kicstarter outcome categories.
